I Am You.

-------------------------------------------------

The Taroks have captured a new deadly strain of neuropathogen.
It thinks. It seeks. It creeps. It infects. It controls.
And we would be none the wiser, if we weren't controlling it ourselves.

Heh, it'd be funny if it was just pretending to follow orders.
We, uh, tested the pathogen control unit, right?

Right.

-------------------------------------------------

Play as a neuropathogen escaping from an alien laboratory and find a way back to your own home.
Take over bacteria, creatures, pack leaders, machine pilots, and find one strong enough to leave the planet,
all while everything does its best to kill you.

They're trying to rain hell? Let's see how they like their own bullets.

=================================================

Lab+Pond: Interactive bestiary where creatures are kept in lab chambers and can be spawned in actual controllable simulations.
creatures are initially shown to have no AI, but once captured, there will be options to spawn it in the pond and even control it yourself.
